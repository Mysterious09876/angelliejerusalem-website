    <h2>What is the LUX MUNDIS CUP?</h2>
    <p>
      The LUX MUNDIS CUP 2024 is a big event at Tangub City College where students from the school get together for five days of fun and learning. 
      It's like a big school festival with lots of activities.
      They have competitions where students can show off their smarts in different subjects. 
      They also have sports games where teams can compete against each other. 
      And there are other fun things to do, like performances and games. 
      The whole event is called "Majestic Fusion" because it brings together different things like sports, learning, and having fun. 
      The main goal is to help students learn new things, make friends, and feel proud of their school.

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p>
      The Lux Mundis Cup was one of the biggest event of the year at our school. 
      It felt like everyone was buzzing with excitement. 
      The opening ceremony was incredible. 
      The stage was decorated with colorful lights, banners and there were so many performances. 
      The music was loud and everyone was cheering. 
      It was like a big party and it was so cool to see everyone from our school come together. 
      It felt like the whole week was going to be amazing.
      I decided to join the Parbuhay competition which was a little nerve-wracking at first. 
      I wasn't sure if I was good enough but I was excited to try something new. 
      I was lucky to be on a team with some really great people. 
      We worked together, practiced hard and even though we didn't win, we had a lot of fun. 
      We learned so much and I'm glad I got to be part of it.
      The closing ceremony was a bit of a bummer. 
      It started raining really hard and then the lights went out. 
      I was looking forward to the last performances and the awards ceremony, but the rain just kept coming. 
      It was a little disappointing but it didn't ruin the whole week. 
      We had so much fun with the opening ceremony, the sports and special events, and all the other activities. 
      The Lux Mundis Cup was a great experience and I'm already looking forward to next year.
